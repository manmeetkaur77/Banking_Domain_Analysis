Banking Customer Data ‚Äì Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Power BI Dashboard
üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on risk analytics in banking and financial services by analyzing customer profiles and transactions. The primary aim is to explore demographics, financial behavior, and customer engagement patterns to minimize lending risk, identify profitable customer segments, and support data-driven decision-making.

The analysis was carried out using EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and results were visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

üéØ Objectives

Identify customer segments based on income, deposits, loans, and loyalty status.

Detect patterns in banking behavior, risk weighting, and fee structure.

Find correlations between income, deposits, loans, and credit balance.

Support risk-based lending decisions and improve customer acquisition and retention strategies.

Build Power BI dashboards for executives to track KPIs and insights.

üìä Key Insights

Demographics:

Gender distribution is nearly equal.

European customers dominate (~44%).

Medium income band is the largest (~51%).


Banking Behavior:

64% hold only one credit card.

High fee structure is most common (~49%).

Jade loyalty tier is highest (~44%).

Risk & Financials:

Conclusion:-

This project demonstrates how EDA and Power BI can be applied to banking data to uncover valuable business insights. Through systematic analysis, we identified risk patterns, customer segments, and financial correlations that can directly support risk-based lending, customer acquisition, and retention strategies.

The Power BI dashboard transforms raw banking data into an interactive decision-support tool, enabling executives to:

Monitor key KPIs in real time

Detect high-risk customers early

Optimize lending and deposit strategies

Strengthen customer loyalty programs
